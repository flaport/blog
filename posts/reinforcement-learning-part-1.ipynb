    "## The Game\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need to create an environment to play te game. We'll represent this environment by the `TicTacToe` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `TicTacToe` object stores the *2D state* of the game, which is represented as a 2D numpy array with 9 elements, such that the positions of the playing board are labeled as follows. Each of those labels represents a possible *action* an player can take.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "0   1   2\n",
    "3   4   5\n",
    "6   7   8\n",
    "```\n",
    "Furthermore, each position on the board can be in 3 differents states. First there is the empty state (a position in the board where nobody has placed a mark yet) denoted by a `0`. Then there is the `O`-state: the state where `player1` has placed a mark denoted by a `1`. Finally there is the `X`-state, denoted by a `2`: the `state` where `player2` has placed a mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example state of the board at a certain time in the game can for example look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ".   X   O       0   2   1\n",
    ".   O   .  -->  0   1   0 \n",
    "X   O   X       2   1   2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these 9 numbers, the current player's *turn* will also be kept track of. The turn index can thus be either `1` or `2`, or `0` when the game is over. The *turn* together with the *2D state* make up the full *state* of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the state of the game, the `TicTacToe` object will also keep a reference to the two players playing the game, so it can ask for an action from either player whenever it's the specific `player`'s turn. A `player` is asked to choose an `action` (move) by its own `get_action` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `action` is asked from a `player`, the `action` is validated and executed by the `play_turn` method of the `TicTacToe` instance. \n",
    "If the action is invalid (for example when choosing a square that is already taken), the player loses. If the `action` results in a line of three equal marks, the current `player` wins. This would result in a `+1` reward if `player1` wins and a `-1` reward if `player2` wins (they have opposite goals, so they receive opposite rewards; more on the reward system later). In all other cases no rewards will be given as no `player` has won (yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the full `state`, `action` and resulting `next_state` and `reward` are given to the player's `learn` method, such that the player can update it's policy according to the reward received, which will make it learn from its mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is useful to have a way to visualize the game each turn. The game `state` can be visualized by setting the `visualize` flag to `True`."

    "## A smarter player\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we define such a smarter `player`? We could probably just code a perfect AI ourselves by coding out some rules that the `player` has to take in each specific position of the board. And for tic-tac-toe, this would probably not be very difficult. However, we'd like a more general approach: enter `Q` learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, `Q` learning works af follows: An `Agent` plays the game according to a certain policy `π`. This policy `π` is such that it chooses the `action` with the maximal `Q` value associated with it for a specific `state` of the game. This `Q` value can be found in a lookup table: the `Q` table, where a different `Q` value is associated with each `state` of the game and the possible `action`s one can take for this specific `state`. Mathematically, one can express this as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\texttt{action} &= \\pi(\\texttt{state}) = \\text{argmax}_{action} Q(\\texttt{state},~\\texttt{action})\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Intuitively, each `Q` value can thus vaguely be linked to the probability of a certain `player` winning the game after playing a certain `action` when the game is in a certain `state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will pitch two Agents against each other. If we assume a higher `Q` value to be associated to a higher chance of `player1` winning, the policy for `player2` will have to be the opposite of the policy of `player1`. `player2`'s policy will thus try to choose the `action` with the minimal `Q` value associated to it. This way of pitching two players against each other while one tries to optimize the objective function and the other tries to minimize it is also known as the `minimax` algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\texttt{player1} &: \\texttt{action} = \\pi(\\texttt{state}) = \\text{argmax}_{action} Q(\\texttt{state},~\\texttt{action})\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the above does not fully describe how the `Q` table is formed. We need to define a way to update the `Q` values after a certain decision has been made. For this, the Bellman equation can be used, which basically describes that the Q-value at the current state of the game should be equal to the reward received at this stage of the game plus a discounted Q-value at the next state of the game.\n",

However, we start with an imperfect `Q` table, which means that at each timestep, there will be an error `δ` between the left hand side and the right hand side of the Bellman equation:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\delta &= Q(\\texttt{state},~\\texttt{action}) - (\\texttt{reward} + \\texttt{discount_factor} \\cdot Q(\\texttt{next-state},~\\texttt{next-action}))\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "`player1` has the policy to *maximize* `Q`, while `player2` will have the policy to *minimize* `Q` and vice versa, which yields for the error on the `Q` values for each of the players:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\texttt{player1} &: \\delta = Q(\\texttt{state},~\\texttt{action}) - (\\texttt{reward} + \\texttt{discount_factor} \\cdot \\text{min}_{\\texttt{action}} Q(\\texttt{next-state},~\\texttt{action})) \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Note that the error on the Q-value for player 1 uses the policy of player 2 [`min`]. This is to be expected, as this policy appears in the discounted Q-value of the next state, which is determined by the other player.\n",

A tic-tac-toe game consists of 9 squares, each of which can be in 3 different states, totalling 3^9 different states (in reality, there are less allowed states possible; 3^9 is an upper bound). We can convert each state to a unique integer to index the qtable. Indexing (calling in this case) the QTable with a state results in a row of the QTable containing 9 qvalues corresponding to the 9 possible actions one can take for each state. Yes, there are 9 possible actions possible at **each** state, even if there are already a few squares taken: the game is programmed in such a way that an invalid move will make you lose, obviously this design choice will make training more difficult but also more general. Note that we only use the *2D state* of the game as key for the Q-table as this is enough to create a unique key to index the underlying table."
