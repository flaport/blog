    "# Creating a Pytorch solver for sparse linear systems\n",
    "Not so long ago, I implemented a [wrapper library in PyTorch to solve sparse linear systems](https://github.com/flaport/torch_sparse_solve) on the CPU using the [SuiteSparse](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) routines under the hood. My goal is to eventually integrate this sparse solver into my photonic circuit simulator, [Photontorch](https://github.com/flaport/photontorch). However, for now, I thought it would be instructive to go over the steps I took to implement both the forward pass and the backward pass of such a custom PyTorch function.\n",
