    "# SSH via a relay server\n",
    "I often connect via SSH to my desktop computer at my desk at University. However, this computer is behind a firewall and I cannot connect to it from my laptop directly. Luckily I have my Virtual Private Server (VPS) where I - among other things - serve this blog. I use this VPS as a relay server to access my desktop from anywhere with my laptop (and vice versa)."

    "First, the desktop needs to allow incoming ssh connections (you might need to install OpenSSH). Usually this is done by enabling and starting a `systemd` service:\n",
    "```\n",
    "desktop-user@desktop$    sudo systemctl enable sshd\n",
    "desktop-user@desktop$    sudo systemctl start sshd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the desktop needs to make a permanent connection with the VPS:\n",
    "```\n",
    "desktop-user@desktop$    ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 vps-user@vps-ip\n",
    "```\n",
    "Apart from connecting to the vps, we also forward port 22 - the standard ssh port - to port 2222 on the VPS. We'll come back to that later. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could background this process and be done with it. However, I prefer something more robust. First create a new ssh id (just keep `id_rsa` as filename and don't create a password for the key) and then copy it to the vps.\n",
    "```\n",
    "desktop-user@desktop$    ssh-keygen\n",
    "desktop-user@desktop$    ssh-copy-id vps-user@vps-ip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After generating and copying your SSH ID to the VPS, you should be able to ssh into the VPS without a password (you might have set this up already when configuring the VPS). Double check this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "desktop-user@desktop$    ssh vps-user@vps-ip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "desktop-user@desktop$    autossh -M 0 -N -R 2222:localhost:22  -i /home/flaport/.ssh/id_rsa -o \"ServerAliveInterval 30\" -o \"ServerAliveCountMax 10\" vps-user@vps-ip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And while we're at it, to make it even more robust, we can create a `systemd` service for this:\n",

    "desktop-user@desktop$    sudo systemctl start sshtunnel\n",
    "```\n",

    "Now, the desktop will create a permanent ssh-tunnel to the vps. The ssh-tunnel will be started at boot (if you enabled the service) and it will be restarted whenever it fails. Perfect!"

    "Connecting the laptop to the VPS works the same as connecting the desktop to the VPS. The discussion from above can largely be repeated (change port 2222 to another port number though).

    "laptop-user@laptop$    ssh -t vps-user@vps-ip ssh -p 2222 desktop-user@localhost\n",

    "\n",
    "The `-t` flag basically executes the second ssh command automatically whenever the first ssh connection is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, using the above command has some downsides. For one, copying files from the laptop to the desktop and vice versa (either via `scp` or via `rsync`) remains impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, a different approach can be followed by editing the SSH config on the laptop:\n",
    "```\n",
    "file: ~/.ssh/config\n",
    "\n",
    "    Host desktop\n",
    "    User desktop-user\n",
    "    ProxyCommand /usr/bin/ssh vps-user@vps -W localhost:2222\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And here it is: connecting to the desktop from the laptop is now as simple as \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "laptop-user@laptop$    ssh desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, copying files and folders can be done with `scp` or `rsync`. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "laptop-user@laptop$    scp file.txt desktop:~/Documents/\n",
    "laptop-user@laptop$    rsync -av ~/Downloads/ desktop:~/Downloads/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! \n",
    "\n",
    "PS: If a connection from the desktop to the laptop is needed, just do the following find and replace \n",
    "```\n",
    "    laptop, desktop => desktop, laptop\n",
    "    2222 => 3333\n",
    "```\n",
